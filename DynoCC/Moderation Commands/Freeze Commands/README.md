# Freeze Command Docs
- How to set up the Freeze command:

**1.** First, add the Freeze commands: [freeze](https://github.com/DynoCC/Dyno-Custom-Commands/blob/master/Moderation%20Commands/Freeze%20Commands/freeze.txt) and [unfreeze](https://github.com/DynoCC/Dyno-Custom-Commands/blob/master/Moderation%20Commands/Freeze%20Commands/unfreeze.txt)

**2.** Then, run `?addrole freeze #ffffff` in your server. This will do some of the setup work for you.

**3.** Next, go to the settings for each channel, and set `freeze` to `can't send messages`, as shown:

*Of course we don't use light theme, we painfully went through the ordeal of turning on light theme to make this image blend in better with the rest of the page.*

Once you complete setting that for each channel, the freeze command should be ready. Simply use `?freeze` to freeze the server, and `?unfreeze` to revert to normal.
Note that on large servers it may take a while to freeze everyone, up to a minute.
Administrators are not affected by freezes.

If you want to customize the freeze command (maybe excludes certain roles), please contact us on our [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/8xBag8Q).

Note: If your server has a different prefix than `?`, you will need to use that prefix in place of `?` in this documentation.
