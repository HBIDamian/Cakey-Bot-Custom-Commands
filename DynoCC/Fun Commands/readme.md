# Fun Commands
Want to spice up your server with some fun commands? Here are a few to include!  

**Note:** In this guide, we assume you are using the ``?`` prefix. Syntax is denoted as ``[input]`` for inputs and ``[input1/input2]`` for choice inputs.

## Simple Commands
- [`?8ball [Question]`](https://github.com/DynoCC/Dyno-Custom-Commands/blob/master/Fun%20Commands/8ball.txt) Returns an [Magic 8 Ball](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_8-Ball) response to your question.
  
- [`?blocked`](https://github.com/DynoCC/Dyno-Custom-Commands/blob/master/Fun%20Commands/blocked.txt) Shows the [Wumpus Picture](https://dynocc.xyz/files/wumpus.PNG) for blocked users.
  
- [`?depressme`](https://github.com/DynoCC/Dyno-Custom-Commands/blob/master/Fun%20Commands/depressme.txt) Shows a [Wumpus Picture](https://dynocc.xyz/files/alone.png)

To use this command, you should also install the [`?roulette`](https://github.com/DynoCC/Dyno-Custom-Commands/blob/master/Fun%20Commands/Mini-Games/roulette.txt) command in the Mini-Games section.
